# 🎭 Face Generation with GANs

This project is part of the [Udacity Deep Learning Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-learning-nanodegree--nd101). It involves building and training a **Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)** to generate realistic-looking human faces using a subset of the CelebA dataset.

## 📌 Project Goals

- Design a **data pipeline** to process face images using PyTorch transforms.
- Build a **custom Generator and Discriminator** using PyTorch `nn.Module`.
- Implement **GAN loss functions** with optional **gradient penalty**.
- Train the GAN to generate human face images.
- Tune the architecture and training strategy iteratively to improve results.

## 🧠 Key Concepts

- Deep Convolutional GAN (DCGAN) architecture
- Adversarial training
- Data normalization and preprocessing
- Use of gradient penalty (optional)
- Modular design with training steps for both Generator and Discriminator

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/face-generation-gan.git
   cd face-generation-gan
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Unzip the dataset:
   ```bash
   unzip processed-celeba-small.zip -d data/
   ```

4. Launch the notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook dlnd_face_generation.ipynb
   ```
